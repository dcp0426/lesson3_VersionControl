            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was first created in 2005, after the destruciton of Linux kernel and BitKeeper. The two softwares fell apart when the relationship between the Linux creator community (which ran solo from 1991 - 2002) and the BitKeeper commercial company (who's software Linux started using in 2002) crumbled. Git was then to rise from the ashes of Linux's attempts with BitKeeper, using knowledge gained during the failed partnership to create something even better. The goal for Git was to make it fast, give it a simple design, have it be distributed completely, give it the ability to handle large projects with speed, and create a system of strong non-lineal development.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control records when someone accesses and/or edits files so that the older versions can still be viewed at a later date. When using a Version Control System (VCS) one has the ability to view how a file has changed over time, find who last altered a file, view a previous version of a file, etc. In other words, it is a bit like a log for file systems. The biggest benefit of a VCS is that lost work is more easily recovered than just a raw file on your computer. Local VCSs are essentially incomplex databases that record the differences between a changed file and it's previous state. Centralized VCSs are single servers that allow multiple users for a set of files with administrators who have final say over any changes. Distributed VCSs allow users to mirror the files on a server on their own computer to avoid losing information in the case of a crashed server. They also allow multiple users to work on the same files at the same time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of VCS. It's unique in comparison to other systems (like Suversion) for multiple reasons. First, it analyzes changes in "snapshots" of file systems rather than changes within changes within individual data. Another innovative feature is that Git gathers files from your local database rather than obtaining it from a seperate server which makes it much faster to work with a file system. Git also checks the integrity of any changes made to any data to avoid corruption or loss of content. Most actions in Git consist of adding data, making it much harder to lose anything you've committed. With Git, there are 3 main states a for a file to be in: committed, modified, and stage. Modifying files happens in the 'work directory' section, staging files adds snapshots of them to the 'staging area' secton, and committing files stores these snapshots permanently in the 'Git directory' section.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Creating a Git Repository can be done oen of two ways: formatting a repository in an already existing directory and importing it to Git or cloning another already existig repository from a seperate server. In order to use an already existing directory, you have to go to the directory and input the command: '$ git init', which will create a subdirectory for to edit yourself. You can also track existing files and perform an initial commit. This is to avoid version-controlling empty directories. In order to clone an already existing repository, you would use the '$ git clone' command followed by the link to the respository in question. This creates a copy of the files included in that repository for you to use or work with.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are some basic commands that are good to know when using Git. To check the status of a file (what state that it is in), you would use the '$ git status' command. A message will appear following your command to tell you its status. Using the '$ git add' command followed the by a file name tracks a new file, making it ready to be committed. In order to commmit a file, you would type the '$ git commit' command. To remove files from your repository, you would first use the '$ git rm' command, which removes the file from the tracked files and working directory, and then use the commit command.</p>
